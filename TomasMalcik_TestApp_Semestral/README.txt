This project needs database to be created on localhost. 
DB Name: SemestralProject
DB Table - you will find that in the .zip file in this folder
#############################################################
Also it needs to have a folder in your c://users/<user>/ - you will also find that folder in the .zip file.
Last thing you need to modify is the route to the files - it is located in "Test.java" and also in "CheckStudent.java"

I hope you can push through this inconvinience.
